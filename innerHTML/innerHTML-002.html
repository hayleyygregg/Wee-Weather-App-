Notes
=====

This builds upon the previous example, adding a second statement to pull out the city. As with the previous example, try changing "Belfast" to "London" and the page will change. 

Again, we could replace this with a variable, so that we can dynamically update the description based on what's returned from OpenWeatherMap.
