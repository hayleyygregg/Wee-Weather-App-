Notes
=====

We can modify the content of an HTML element by using the innerHTML property. Here's the syntax:

	document.getElementById(id).innerHTML = "Content goes here.";

In the brackets after `getElementById` we're pinpointing the p with the id of "weather".

Try changing "Sunny" to "Rainy" and you'll see the page change. I'll explore the other aspects of this (`document.getElementById(id)`) later, but I wanted to at least pick off this low hanging fruit.

We've used this in our wee weather app:

	document.getElementById("description").innerHTML = description;

In our wee weather app we're using a variable `description` (paired with an id of "description") so that we can dynamically update the description based on what's returned from OpenWeatherMap.
